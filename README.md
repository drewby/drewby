# Hi there, I'm Drew! 👋

I'm passionate about improving the efficiency and effectiveness of engineers in their daily work, with a particular interest in observability and platform engineering. 

## 🌱 Current Interests

- [OpenTelemetry](https://github.com/open-telemetry) - An observability framework for cloud-native software
- [Dapr](https://github.com/dapr) - A portable, event-driven, runtime for building distributed applications across cloud and edge

## ✨ Observability newsletter 

I'm writing a newsletter on Observability: A Platform Engineer's Perspective. From high level concepts to diving deep into code.
